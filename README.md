#### How to Run
This Reddit Bot requires the PRAW (a Reddit API and toolkit) package. To obtain
the package, follow the instructions on the PRAW website to install it: 
https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

You'll likely want to install PRAW via the terminal by the Python IDE of your 
choice (ie Pycharm).

After getting the PRAW to work and some configurations pull the code from Github
into your Python IDE via the terminal. Make sure you have a separate directory 
for this bot. 

When you see the "botKeys.py" code of the file, fill in the
credentials with your username, password, and developer keys (client id from
creating your application, etc.) In case you don't recall on how to create a
Reddit bot/script app ID: I (Bryan) recommend this Youtube video in getting the
credentials dealt with. The recommended range is from 0:40 to 1:42.

Once the code is in the proper directory fill in the credentials of your Reddit
account and your app ID in botKeys.py, and you can run the app.

#### How the Bot Works
This is a Reply Bot. This bot can reply to submissions on a given subreddit
and do so on many submissions. This bot can streamline multiple comment activity
such as promotions, warnings, and meme responses.

Note: While this bot has the potential to be use for somewhat annoying purposes 
(such as spam), this bot can be used to streamline comments that can be made on
multiple submissions on any subreddit.

To run the bot, open your Python IDE of choice and run it, preferably via the
terminal. Then the program will ask for the subreddit, phrase to use, and
keywords the bot can look out for. Then the bot can start commenting on the
submissions on a chosen subreddit and let the comments repeat!
